Left: one RNN cell (labeled A) at time t, taking input x_t and its own previous hidden state (loop) to produce a new hidden state h_t. Right: the same cell unfolded across timesteps 0...t. At each step, a fresh copy of A consumes x_0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_t (and the prior hidden state) to yield h_0, h_1, h_2, ..., h_t. Unrolling turns the cyclic graph into a feed-forward chain, enabling standard backpropagation through time.](./pics/rnnCell_unrolling.png)\n",

Many-to-one: A whole input sequence (e.g. words of a sentence) is read in step by step, and only the final hidden state produces one output (e.g. sentiment score, classification). Many-to-Many: Input and output sequences of the same length, aligned in time (e.g. part-of-speech tagging, where each word -> each tag).
