    "![Computation‑graph/back‑prop example for a 2‑dimensional logistic‑regression node f = w_{0}x_{0} + w_{1}x_{1} + w_{2} passed through the sigmoid. Forward pass (green): each multiply gives w_{0}x_{0} = -2,\\; w_{1}x_{1} = 6; the add node outputs q = 4; adding the bias yields s = 1; negating, exponentiating, adding 1, and inverting produce the sigmoid output \\hat{y} = 0.73. Backward pass (red): starting with \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial \\hat{y}} = 1, gradients flow back through reciprocal, addition, exp, etc., giving \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial s} = 0.20, which splits to \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial q} = 0.20 and \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial w_{2}} = 0.20; at the earlier add node this further distributes so that \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial (w_{0}x_{0})} = \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial (w_{1}x_{1})} = 0.20; multiplying by inputs yields \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial w_{0}} = -0.20,\\; \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial w_{1}} = -0.39 and \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial x_{0}} = 0.20w_{0} = -0.40,\\; \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial x_{1}} = 0.20w_{1} = -0.60, illustrating how the chain rule traverses the logistic‑regression graph to provide exact gradients for every weight and input.](./pics/compGraph_complex.png)"
