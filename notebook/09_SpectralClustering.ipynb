    "    - Members of different clusters are dissimilar\n",
    "- **Usually**:\n",
    "    - Points are in a high-dimensional space\n",
    "    - Similarity is defined using a distance measure\n",
    "    - Euclidean, Cosine, Jaccard, edit distance, ...\n",

    "## Clustering Problem: Music\n",
    "- Intuitively: **Music divides into categories, and customers prefer a few categories**\n",

    "## Overview: Methods of Clustering\n",
    "- **Hierarchical**:\n",
    "    - *Agglomerative* (bottom up):\n",
    "        - Initially, each point is a cluster\n",
    "        - Repeatedly combine the two “nearest” clusters into one\n",
    "    - *Divisive* (top down):\n",
    "        - Start with one cluster and recursively split it\n",
    "- **Point assignment**:\n",
    "    - Maintain a set of clusters\n",
    "    - Points belong to “nearest” cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hierarchical Clustering\n",
    "![dendrogram from an agglomerative hierarchical clustering](./pics/hClustering_dendogram.png)\n",
    "- **Key operation**: Repeatedly combine two nearest clusters\n",
    "- Three important questions:\n",
    "    1. How do you represent a cluster of more than one point?\n",
    "        - **Key problem**: As you merge clusters, how do you represent the “location” of each cluster, to tell which pair of clusters is closest?\n",
    "        - Euclidean case: each cluster has a *centroid* = average of its (data)points\n",
    "    2. How do you determine the “nearness” of clusters?\n",
    "        - Euclidean case: Measure cluster distances by distances of centroids\n",
    "    3. When to stop combining clusters?\n",
    "\n",
    "![visual showing example of clustering with euclidian data with a centroid-based method on the left, agglomerative hierarchical clustering on the right](./pics/clustering_euclidian.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## And in the Non-Euclidean Case?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The only “locations” we can talk about are the points themselves\n",
    "    - i.e., there is no “average” of two points\n",
    "- Approach 1:\n",
    "    1. How to represent a cluster of many points?\n",
    "        - *clustroid* = (data)point **“closest”** to other points\n",
    "    2. How do you determine the “nearness” of clusters?\n",
    "        - Treat clustroid as if it were centroid, when computing inter-cluster distances\n",
    "\n",
    "## “Closest” Point?\n",
    "1. How to represent a cluster of many points?\n",
    "    - *clustroid* = point **“closest”** to other points\n",
    "- Possible meanings of “closest”:\n",
    "    - Smallest maximum distance to other points\n",
    "    - Smallest average distance to other points\n",
    "    - Smallest sum of squares of distances to other points\n",
    "        - For distance metric $d$ clustroid $c$ of cluster $C$ is: $$ \\min_{c}\\;\\sum_{x \\in C} d(x, c)^{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "![visual showing cluster on 3 datapoints, with clustroid and centroid marked](./pics/closestPoint_visual.png)\n",
    "- **Centroid** is the avg. of all (data)points in the cluster. This means centroid is an “artificial” point.\n",
    "- **Clustroid** is an existing (data)point that is “closest” to all other points in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining “Nearness” of Clusters\n",
    "2. How do you determine the “nearness” of clusters?\n",
    "    - Approach 2: **Intercluster distance** = minimum of the distances between any two points, one from each cluster\n",
    "    - Approach 3: Pick a notion of **“cohesion”** of clusters, e.g., maximum distance from the clustroid\n",
    "      - Merge clusters whose *union* is most cohesive\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cohesion\n",
    "- Approach 3.1: Use the **diameter** of the merged cluster = maximum distance between points in the cluster\n",
    "- Approach 3.2: Use the **average distance** between points in the cluster\n",
    "- Approach 3.3: Use a **density-based approach**\n",
    "    - Take the diameter or avg. distance, e.g., and divide by the number of points in the cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "- Naïve implementation of hierarchical clustering:\n",
    "    - At each step, compute pairwise distances between all pairs of clusters, then merge\n",
    "    - $O(N^3)$\n",
    "- Careful implementation using priority queue can reduce time to $O(N^{2}\\log(N))$\n",
    "    - Still too expensive for really big datasets that do not fit in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "## $k$–means Algorithm(s)\n",
    "- Assumes Euclidean space/distance\n",
    "- Start by picking $k$, the number of clusters\n",
    "- Initialize clusters by picking one point per cluster\n",
    "- Example: Pick one point at random, then $k-1$ other points, each as far away as possible from the previous points\n",
    "\n",
    "## Populating Clusters\n",
    "1. For each point, place it in the cluster whose current centroid it is nearest\n",
    "2. After all points are assigned, update the locations of centroids of the $k$ clusters\n",
    "3. Reassign all points to their closest centroid\n",
    "    - Sometimes moves points between clusters\n",
    "- Repeat 2 and 3 until convergence\n",
    "    - **Convergence**: Points don’t move between clusters and centroids stabilize\n",
    "\n",
    "## The wrong method of getting the $k$ right\n",
    "- **How to select k?**\n",
    "    - Try different $k$, looking at the change in the average distance to centroid as $k$ increases\n",
    "    - Average falls rapidly until right $k$, then changes little\n",
    "    - **WRONG**\n",
    "    - Stop using the elbow criteron method for k-means and how to choose the number of clusters instead\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems with the elbow method\n",
    "- Heuristic with absolutely no theoretical support\n",
    "- Easy to draw very poor conclusions\n",
    "- Better alternatives have existed in the literature\n",
    "\n",

First and second row: eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $L_{rw}$ and $L$ based on the $k$-nearest-neighbor graph. Third and fourth row: eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $L_{rw}$ and $L$ based on the fully connected graph. For all plots, we used the Gaussian kernel with $\\sigma = 1$ as similarity function.\n",
    "- Each panel shows the eigenvalue “scree” and then plots of eigenvectors 1–5. You can clearly see how the normalized Laplacian on the $k$-NN graph (first and second rows) produces a clean block-constant behavior in its second, third, etc. eigenvectors, exactly the piecewise-constant signals you need for clustering, whereas the unnormalized or fully-connected choices smear out those plateaus and make cluster recovery harder.\n",

    "- Three data sets, and the smallest 10 eigenvalues of $L_{rw}$.\n",
    "- Left column: Four clearly separated Gaussian peaks. The spectrum shows four (near)‐zero eigenvalues before a big jump at the 5th eigenvalue—exactly signaling four clusters.\n",
    "- Middle column: Four Gaussians but with more overlap. Now you see one exact zero, then three small but nonzero eigenvalues, then a spectral gap—indicating that cluster structure is still present but less clean.\n",
    "- Right column: Noisy distribution. The eigenvalues rise smoothly from zero with no clear gap, telling you there is no meaningful multi-way partition to be found.\n",
    "- In other words, as the underlying clusters become less well‐separated, the multiplicity and distinctness of the near-zero eigenvalues shrinks and blurs, which is the spectral hallmark of diminishing cluster structure.\n",

    "- Very noisy datasets cause problems\n",
    "    - “Informative” eigenvectors need not be in top few\n",
