However, what happens when you encounter a word $X_i$ in a test set for which you do not have a corresponding $P(X_i | Y)$? By default, this sets a probability of 0, but this is problematic in a Naive Bayes setting: since you're computing $P(X_1 | Y) P(X_2 | Y) ... P(X_n | Y)$ for a document, a single probability of 0 in that string of multiplication nukes the entire statement!"
