    "    - Y axis is number of nodes whose degree is $\\ge k$\n",
    "- Typically use a log-log scale\n",
    "    - Straight lines are a power law; normal curve dives to zero at some point\n",

    "![Cumulative degree plot with red points that are the actual degree counts from some real graph and blue points are from an R-MAT–generated synthetic graph of the same size](./pics/degree_plot1.png)\n",
    "- You can see both graphs roughly lie on a straight line in the midrange—showing the R-MAT model produces a similar heavy‐tailed degree distribution to the original network. this is how you check (and compare) whether your data—or your generator—really follows a power‐law degree distribution, by looking for that straight line on a log–log cumulative‐count plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Cumulative degree plot with a green best fit line, blue empirical curve (the actual data), and a vertical marker near k=100 where the emperical curve bends sharply downward](./pics/degree_plot2.png)\n",

    "- The blue empirical curve (the actual data) bends sharply downward around some $k \\approx 100$\n",
    "- That bending point is where the power law breaks—no nodes exist above that degree—so it defines the maximum scale (finite-size cutoff) of the network\n",

    "![6 cumulative degree distributions: collaborations in math, citations, world wide web, internet, power grid, and protien interaction](./pics/degree_plot3.png)\n",
    "- Cumulative degree distributions for six different networks. The horizontal axis for each panel is vertex degree $k$ (or indegree for the citation and Web networks, which are directed) and the vertical axis is the cumulative probability distribution of degrees, i.e., the fraction of vertices that have degree greater than or equal to $k$. The networks shown are: (a) the collaboration network of mathematicians [182]; (b) citations between 1981 and 1997 to all papers cataloged by the Institute for Scientific Information [351]; (c) a 300 million vertex subset of the World Wide Web, circa 1999 [74]; (d) the Internet at the level of autonomous systems, April 1999 [86]; (e) the power grid of the western United States [416]; (f) the interaction network of proteins in the metabolism of the yeast S. Cerevisiae [212]. Of these networks, three of them, (c), (d) and (f), appear to have power-law degree distributions, as indicated by their approximately straight-line forms on the doubly logarithmic scales, and one (b) has a power-law tail but deviates markedly from power-law behavior for small degree. Network (e) has an exponential degree distribution (note the log-linear scales used in this panel) and network (a) appears to have a truncated power-law degree distribution of some type, or possibly two separate power-law regimes with different exponents.\n",

    "- Barabási–Albert: nodes were added one by one, each leeching $m$ edges onto existing nodes with probability proportional to their current degree (“rich get richer”). You can instantly see the hubs—a handful of high-degree nodes with the bulk of the edges radiating out, and many low-degree nodes hanging on the outskirts\n",
