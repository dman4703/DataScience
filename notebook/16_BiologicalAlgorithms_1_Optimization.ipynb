(c) Selection: Two pairs of parents are drawn at random but weighted by those probabilities (dotted line marks the crossover point). (d) Crossover: Each parent pair swaps the segment left of the cut, producing two new offspring strings.

    "## Advantages of Derivative-free methods\n",
    "- Can optimize pretty much anything\n",
    "    - No need for a known or closed form derivative (“black box optimization”)\n",
    "    - Just need some way of evaluating whether or not a specific guess is “good” (e.g., a fitness function)\n",
    "- Straightforward to implement\n",
    "- Only real constraint (usually) is time\n",
    "    - Fairly resource-light, can scale up to use available resources\n",

    "## Disadvantages of Derivative-free methods\n",
    "- Often no convergence guarantees\n",
    "    - EA is guaranteed to find a local optimum\n",
    "    - Annealing is *theoretically* guaranteed to find a global optimum (but could be waiting until the heat death of the universe)\n",
    "- Relies heavily on hand-tuned hyperparameters\n",
    "    - Temperature protocol, mutation rate, cognitive / social parameters\n",
    "- \"Long tail\" convergence\n",
