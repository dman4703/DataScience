Right panel shows (seq2seq) encoder–decoder architecture drawn as two unrolled RNNs. Encoder: an RNN reads the input sequence{x^(1) to x^(n_x)} step by step, passing its hidden state forward. The final hidden state is collapsed into a fixed-length context vector C. Decoder: a second RNN is initialized (or conditioned) on C and then unrolled to generate the output sequence {y^(1) to y^(n_y)}; At each timestep it takes as input its previous output (or a special start token) plus C to produce the next symbol. Solid arrows show the usual recurrent connections (hidden-to-hidden and hidden-to-output). The heavy arrow from the encoder’s last state into the decoder indicates that context vector C is fed into every decoder step. Dashed arrows typically denote teacher-forcing links (feeding ground-truth y^(t−1) during training).](./pics/rnn_ex.png)\n",

    "![high-level schematic of a Transformer used for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., machine translation). On the left is a stack of encoder layers (here, six “ENCODER” blocks) that read the input tokens “Je suis étudiant” and build contextualized representations via self-attention and feed-forward sublayers. On the right is a stack of decoder layers (six “DECODER” blocks) that generate the output sequence “I am a student.” Each decoder layer has: Masked self-attention over the tokens generated so far (to prevent seeing future words), Encoder–decoder (cross) attention — shown by the arrows from the top of the encoder stack to every decoder block — which lets the decoder attend to all positions of the encoded input, and feed-fowrard processing. illustrates how the Transformer’s decoder repeatedly queries (“attends to”) the encoder’s outputs at each layer to produce the target translation (I am a student)](./pics/seq2seqTransformer_schematic.png)\n",

    "![ worked numerical example of scaled dot-product self-attention on two tokens (“Thinking” and “Machines”). 1. embeddings: Each word is first mapped to an embedding x_1, x_2. 2. Linear Projections: x_1, x_2 get turned into queries q_1 and q_2, keys k_1 and k_2, and value v_1 and v_2 vectors for each token. Score computation: dot products q_1 \\cdot k_1 = 112 and q_1 \\cdot k_2 = 96 is computed. Scaling: divide by \\sqrt{d_{k}}=8, score becomes 14 and 12. Softmax: convert to attention weights 0.88 and 0.12. Weighted sum: multiply each value by its weight and sum: z_1 =  0.88v_1 + 0.12v_2. The same process (with its own dot-products, scaling, softmax) yields z_2 for the second token. illustrates exactly how a single attention head “looks up” related tokens and blends their value vectors into new, context-aware representations.](./pics/selfAttention_ex.png)\n",

Inner grid: at row j, column i you get the raw dot-product score K̅_{j} \\cdot Q̅_{i} (visualized by circle size/intensity) — i.e. how much token i “attends to” token j. Normally you’d then scale, softmax, and weight the value vectors V̅_j = E_{j}W^V according to those scores to produce each output z_i. it’s the classic “queries vs keys” attention map, showing all pairwise compatibilities before they get normalized into attention weights.](./pics/selfAttention_matrix.png)\n",

Head 1 likewise uses W_{1}^{Q}, W_{1}^{K}, W_{1}^{V} to compute Q_1, K_1, V_1. Each head then performs scaled dot-product attention independently on its (Q_i, K_i, V_i) before their outputs are concatenated and mixed.

Patch -> visual embedding: Each patch is flattened into a vector and multiplied by a learned projection matrix W_e, producing a visual embedding for that patch. Add Positional Encoding: A corresponding positional embedding is looked up from a small table (one entry per patch index) and added to the visual embedding, yielding the final token embedding. Those token embeddings (one per patch) are then fed into the Transformer’s encoder exactly as in NLP—everything else (self-attention, feed-forward layers) remains unchanged.](./pics/vit_visual.png)\n",

A direct residual connection from u bypasses all blocks and is added back at the end to form the output y. To generate each filter h^n efficiently, a small feed-forward network transforms a fixed “window” of positional embeddings (encoding relative distances) into the full-length convolution kernel, allowing Hyena to mix global context in linear time and constant memory.](./pics/hyena_arch.png)\n",
