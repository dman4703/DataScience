## [1. Vectors](https://nbviewer.org/github/engineersCode/EngComp4_landlinear/blob/master/notebook_en/01_Transform_all_the_Vectors.ipynb)
What is a vector? The physicist's view versus the computer scientist's view. Fundamental vector operations: visualizing vector addition and multiplication by a scalar. Intuitive presentation of basis vectors, linear combination and span. What is a matrix? A matrix as a linear transformation mapping a vector in one space, to another space. Visualizing linear transformations. Matrix-vector multiplication: a linear combination of the matrix columns. Some special transformations: rotation, shear, scaling. Matrix-matrix multiplication: a composition of two linear transformations. Idea of inverse of a matrix as a transformation that takes vectors back to where they came from.

## [2. Matrices](https://nbviewer.org/github/engineersCode/EngComp4_landlinear/blob/master/notebook_en/02_Matrix_is_Everywhere.ipynb)
A matrix is a linear transformation… visualize it. Norm of a vector. A matrix maps a circle to an ellipse… visualize it. A vector that doesn't change direction after a linear transformation is an eigenvector of the matrix. A matrix is a system of equations… visualize it (row perspective). Inconsistent and underdetermined systems. A matrix is a change of basis… visualize it. An inverse of that matrix will change the vector's coordinates back to the original basis. Matrices in three-dimensional space: linear transformations in 3D; 3D systems of linear equations; dimension and rank. Visualize the transformations of rank-deficient matrices.

## [3. Eigenvectors](https://nbviewer.org/github/engineersCode/EngComp4_landlinear/blob/master/notebook_en/03_Eigenvectors_FTW.ipynb)
Geometry of eigendecomposition. Eigenvectors revisited: a matrix transforms a circle to an ellipse, whose semimajor and semiminor axes align with the eigenvectors. Composition of scaling transformation and a rotation transformation: not enough! Complete the composition. Symmetric matrices, orthogonal eigenvectors. Eigendecomposition in general. Diagonalizable matrices. Similar matrices. Eigendecomposition is similarity via a change of basis. Compute eigenthings in Python, using NumPy or SymPy. Eigenvalues in ecology: matrix population models. Markov chains. PageRank algorithm.
