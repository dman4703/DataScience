# Dense Motion Analysis

## Motion analysis
- Our world is in motion
![pictures of moving objects](./pics/motionAnalysis_movingPics)
- Core problem in computer vision
- Examples:
  - Object tracking
  - Trajectory analysis
  - Object finding
  - Video enhancement, stabilization, 3D reconstruction, object recognition

 ## Perception vs Representation
 - We can *perceive* motion where none exists, or not perceive motion where motion exists
 - Shapeless or transparent objects, or limited sight, are problematic
 - Computer would not see motion in the previous images (which is good)
 - … computer doesn’t “see” in the human sense
 - Point being: **computers only analyze motion of opaque, solid objects**
 - Key: **motion representation**
